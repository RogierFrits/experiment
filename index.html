                    <p class="lead">As you were reading in an old journal of Neurophysiology from 2013 you have a brilliant new insight on the model for ‘Interaction between cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making’ by M. Guthrie, A Leblois, A. Garenne, T. Boraud.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Luckily for you, the code for this model has recently been uploaded to GitHub. You found a splendid tutorial and decide to stick to that approach. You first want to successfully run the existing code before making the changes of your brilliant new insight.</p>
            <p>With the help of Google, you estimate it will take you roughly 15 minutes. After that you will report your findings by answering a few questions. If you are really stuck and want to give up please remember the step you’ve reached and time it took you. Then continue answering the questions as well.</p>
